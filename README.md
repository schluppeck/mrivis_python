Stimuli for fMRI experiments written in [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html)

Stimuli can either be run via command line (my preferred) if PsychoPy module is installed or via the PsychoPy GUI.

Also contains some wrapper shell scripts to run files with specific parameters for previous experiments
